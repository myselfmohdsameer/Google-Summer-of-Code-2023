Miro is #1 cloud based online whiteboard for visual collaboration, I got the chance to make its app for Rocket.Chat (The world's largest open source communications platform)

I intend to maintain this repository as a work progress/final report summary of my GSoC work and a quick guide for all future GSoC aspirants.

## ‚≠ê Project Abstract

Teams collaborate on Rocket.Chat, using Miro is the go-to app for teams and channel members of any Rocket.Chat room for a their project/team management. This project aims to completely synchronize Miro boards and board members with members on Rocket.Chat using features like board notifications and member management.

## üö¢ Deliverables

The following are the deliverables of this project:
- Allowing users to get their boards and manage them.
- Allowing users to subscribe to board events and get real time notifications.
- Allowing users to create/get/change their boards.
- Allowing users to embed boards in rooms.
- Enabling users to create set and update roles of board members right from Rocket.Chat.

**All of the above deliverables were completed within the GSoC period. Yay! üéâ**

A big big thank you to my mentors for their guidance before and throughout GSoC. üôè
